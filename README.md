## Hello friend!

_I'm really happy that you're reading this. This is the latest version of my application [pKiLL](https://github.com/sreehariskumar/pKiLL) with an enhanced UI._  


### INTRODUCTION
pKiLL is a program that I've created which can be used to start/restart/end unresponsive applications in linux. The GUI helps to achieve this with ease. 



### USAGE
The app can be used to start/restart or end an application.

Type the name of the application in the input field.
1. Start - runs the application

2. Restart - restarts the application if the application is already running

3. End - the application process will be killed


### Wait no more and let us proceed to the installation process.


Clone the repository to your system.
```s
git clone https://github.com/sreehariskumar/pKiLL-v2.0.git
```
Navigate to the folder.
```s
cd pKiLL-v2.0
```

Grant execute permission to the begin.sh script to make the script executable. 
```s
chmod +x begin.sh
```

Run the begin.sh script to install necessary dependencies for the smooth functioning of the application.
```s
./begin.sh
```


Once the installation has completed, run the following command to open the app: 
```s
python3 pKiLL.py
```


 #### Enjoy using the app.
 #### Please let me know your views on the application. Thank you.
