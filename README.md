Hello friend!

I'm really happy that you're reading this.
This is a new version of my application https://github.com/sreehariskumar/pKiLL with an enhanced GUI.
Wait no more and let us proceed to the installation process.


INTRODUCTION
============
pKiLL is a program that I've created which can be used to start/end unresponsive applications in linux. The GUI helps to achieve this with ease. Try it youself.

1. Extract the tar file:
   tar -xvf pKiLL.tar

2. Run the install.sh to install necessary dependencies for the smooth functioning of the application:
   cd pKiLL ; sh install.sh

3. After the installation:
   python3 pKiLL.py


Enjoy using the app.


Please let me know your views on the application.
Thank you.
